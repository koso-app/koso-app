K Lap is a mobile app that supports both Android and iOS systems. It is used to connect with KOSO PowerTry device for lap timing and custom start/finish timing on your vehicle. Through K Lap, you can record your racing process and data as a video for playback and reference.

KOSO PowerTry device is built with highly efficient GPS and gyro modules, which can record data at a high frequency and provide very accurate and effective values. Compared to other apps that only use phone GPS data, KOSO PowerTry's data is much more precise. In addition to connecting with K Lap, KOSO PowerTry can also be used with K Race for straight-line acceleration performance testing and vehicle tuning.



## FAQ

**Can K Lap be used without connecting to the device?**

No, K Lap cannot be used on its own. It needs to be connected to the PowerTry device through Bluetooth on your phone. K Lap obtains high-precision and high-frequency location, three-dimensional acceleration, and other information through Bluetooth to calculate the lap timing and start/finish timing statistics.

**What are the main functions of K Lap?**

K Lap supports two types of race timing: lap timing and start/finish timing. In lap timing, when the vehicle passes the starting point, it will automatically calculate the lap time and distance, and record each lap's results. In start/finish timing, when the vehicle passes the starting point, the timer will start and only stop when the vehicle reaches the set finish line.

**Is K Lap a permanently free app?**

Currently, K Lap is a free app, but it may be subject to adjustment in the future based on product production and sales strategies.



## Requirements

**What are the phone permissions used by K Lap?**

K Lap uses phone permissions related to Bluetooth connection, obtaining phone location, and running in the background with phone location. Since K Lap connects KOSO PowerTry and the phone through Bluetooth protocol, Bluetooth-related permissions are mandatory, including permissions for Bluetooth device scanning and Bluetooth connection management. Phone location permission is used for Android devices to continue Bluetooth connection in the background.

The location data obtained by K Lap will not be shared or disseminated with other users, nor will it be used for tracking purposes. It is only used for users to view and calculate data on their own.



## Operation

**User login**

Users can register using a Google account, Apple account (iOS version only), or email address. This account will be used to remotely save the user's created vehicle data.

**K Lap track editor**

K Lap has already included some official tracks for users to test. If the track is not listed in the official tracks, K Lap provides a track editor that allows users to create a suitable track and start/finish line timing race. Please note that K Lap is designed for use on tracks only and should not be used on public roads. Users should also follow safety regulations when using K Lap.

**Track racing test**

After connecting with KOSO Powertry, K Lap will obtain high-precision location data through Bluetooth communication to calculate the speed and time spent for the timed race or lap race. Before starting a race, users need to create vehicle information to differentiate between different vehicles' test results. After selecting the track to be used, K Lap will automatically determine the start and end status of the race and automatically record and calculate lap data in a lap race. The app will also open the phone camera to record the entire process of the race for users to view the historical records later.

**Historical data storage**

After the track test ends, K Lap compares the recorded video and data time to allow users to use the playback function to review the recorded video and data during the test. Please note that this data is not uploaded to the server for remote storage, and when the app is deleted, the test history data will be deleted as well.
