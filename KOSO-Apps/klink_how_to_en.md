## Introduction to K Link App

K Link is an Android and iOS mobile application that allows users to connect to KOSO-produced Bluetooth-enabled motorcycle speedometer to activate navigation and provide maintenance and repair information recording tools.



## FAQ

**Do I need to connect to a vehicle to use K Link?**

Some functions of K Link do not require connection to a vehicle, such as weather status, fuel price status inquiry, or maintenance and refueling records. However, some functions require connection to a vehicle, such as the gauge navigation function. You need to connect to the vehicle via the mobile app, and set the destination before the navigation guidance can be displayed on the gauge.



**Which speedometer can be connected to and operated by K Link?**

Currently, the KOSO RX-5 gauge is the only gauge that can be connected to and operated by K Link. For purchasing information, please visit the [KOSO official website](https://www.koso.com.tw/) or contact them.



**Is K Link a permanently free app?**
Currently, K Link is a free application, but it may be subject to adjustments based on production and commercial sales strategies in the future.


## Requirements


**What phone permissions does K Link use?**

K Link requires phone permissions including Bluetooth connection, obtaining phone location, and running in the background. Since K Link uses Bluetooth protocol to connect the gauge and the phone, Bluetooth connection permissions are necessary, including permissions for Bluetooth device scanning and connection management. The phone location permission is used for weather information, track recording, and providing a simple speedometer display when connected to the gauge.

The location data obtained by K Link will not be shared or disseminated with other users, nor will it be used for tracking purposes, only for the user's own viewing.


## Operation


**Vehicle Navigation Function**

K Link uses Google Map data for navigation and prompts. After connecting to the vehicle via Bluetooth, the navigation function can display turn prompts on the motorcycle's dashboard.

When using the navigation function in K Link, users can search for the destination by entering keywords or selecting one of the three preset search options for repair shops, gas stations, or parking lots to find nearby locations. After selecting the navigation destination, users can start the navigation. If the phone is connected to the vehicle gauge during the navigation process, the turn road names, direction prompts, next turn distance, and estimated arrival time will be displayed on the gauge.



**Real-time Vehicle Information**

Once connected with the vehicle odometer, K Link will obtain real-time information via Bluetooth communication, including vehicle speed, RPM, fuel consumption, remaining maintenance mileage, battery voltage, gear position, as well as mileage 1 and mileage 2 data. Even when offline, K Link saves the latest data in the app, allowing users to view the data since the last connection while the app is connected to the vehicle.



**Weather and Oil Price**

When K Link is opened, it will retrieve the weather forecast for the current location through the internet and create a chart displaying the temperature and rainfall trends for the past 24 hours.

Real-time oil prices are obtained from the prices released by 中國石油公司.



**Fuel and Maintenance Record**

K Link provides a simple tool to record fuel and maintenance history, allowing users to record the price or maintenance items during refueling or vehicle maintenance, to keep track of maintenance history and trends.
