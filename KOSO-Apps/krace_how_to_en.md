**★  This app is designed for use on the racetrack, please do not use it on general roads and streets. Be aware to  follow safety regulations.**

K Race is a data monitoring tool that assists motor and car drivers in tuning vehicle performance. When connecting to the KOSO Powertry device via Bluetooth, the driving data can be monitored efficiently. Because the KOSO Powertry device has built-in high-efficiency GPS and gyroscope modules and can record data at relatively high-frequency intervals, it can provide very accurate and effective values. Compared with other apps that only use mobile phone GPS data, Its data will be much more precise.
In the performance test function, you can choose speed or distance test. For example, a 0-100 speed test or a distance test of 400 meters. Through the test, the performance and data of the current vehicle can be further understood, and the data can be further displayed in the form of segmented charts and graphs, so the driver can easily compare these data with each other and use them in performance tuning, and observe its performance. As a result, the K Race will be a great tool for performing performance tuning.
In K Race, it has distance and speed exams such as a 0-100 speed exam or a distance exam of 400 meters. Through these exams, these result data can be presented as data tables and trend graphs. Users can easily compare these data with each other and use them in performance tuning, and observe their performance. As a result, the K Race will be a great tool for performance tuning.
